# LinearThermoViscoElasticity

Here we have a selection of Mathematica packages to calculate linear thermo-visco-elastic wave propagation and scattering. The scattering case only includes refleciton and transmission in halfspace, and scattering from a sphere.

These repo also contains a sample of Mathematica notebooks used by the paper **A unified framework for linear thermo-visco-elastic wavepropagation including the effects of stress-relaxation** in the folder [TVE-paper](TVE-paper). In the folder are instructions on what each notebook produces.
